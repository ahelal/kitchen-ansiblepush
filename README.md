A test-kitchen plugin that adds the support for ansible in push mode i.e. normal mode :)

## Intro
This kitchen plugin adds ansible as a provisioner in push mode. Ansible will run from your host rather than run from guest instance(s). That also means your code will not be copied to guest. 

It is designed to just simply work with minimum configuration. Just run as you would normaly do. 

## How to install

### (1) Use Bundler
My preferred method is use Gemfile

```ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"
group :development do
  gem 'test-kitchen'
  gem 'kitchen-vagrant' # for example
  gem 'kitchen-ansiblepush'
end
```

### (2) Ruby gem
```bash
gem install kitchen-ansiblepush
```

### (3) Install from code
```bash
git clone git@github.com:ahelal/kitchen-ansiblepush.git
cd kitchen-ansiblepush
gem build kitchen-ansiblepush.gemspec
gem install kitchen-ansiblepush-<version>.gem
```

## kitchen.yml Options
```yaml
provisioner         :
    ## required options
    name                : ansible_push
    playbook            : "../../plays/web.yml"     # Path to Play yaml
    ##
    ## Optional  argument
    ansible_config      : "/path/to/ansible/ansible.cfg" # path to ansible config file
    verbose             : "vvvv" # verbose level v, vv, vvv, vvvv
    diff                : true  # print file diff
    mygroup             : "web" # ansible group, or list of groups
    raw_arguments       : "--timeout=200"
    extra_vars          : "@vars.yml"
    tags                : [ "that", "this" ]
    skip_tags           : [ "notme", "orme" ]
    start_at_task       : [ "five" ]
    # Hash of other groups
    groups              :
         db             :
            - db01
    sudo                : true
    sudo_user           : root
    remote_user         : ubuntu
    private_key         : "/path..../id_rsa"
    ask_vault_pass      : true
    vault_password_file : "/..../file"
    host_key_checking   : false
    generate_inv        : true
    use_instance_name   : false  # use short (platform) instead of instance name by default
    idempotency_test    : false
```
## Idempotency test
If you want to check your code is idempotent you can use the idempotency_test. Essentially, this will run Ansible twice and check nothing changed in the second run. If something changed it will list the tasks. Note: If your using Ansible callback in your config this might conflict.

```yaml
    idempotency_test: true
    fail_non_idempotent: true
```

If your running ansible V2 you need to white list the callback ```callback_whitelist = changes``` in **ansible.cfg**
You can also choose to not to fail if idempotency test fails.

##  Ansible version
Since ansiblepush uses the host to run Ansible. you can simply specify the path of your ansible-playbook executable in your .kitchen.yml

```yaml
ansible_playbook_bin : /path/to/ansible-playbook
```

If you want any easy way to manage ansible version [AVM](https://github.com/ahelal/avm)
For further example you can check a matrix test [ansible-usermanage](https://github.com/AutomationWithAnsible/ansible-usermanage/blob/master/.kitchen.yml)

## Disable chef installation
By default chef is installed and serverspec stuff. if you don't want to install

```yaml
chef_bootstrap_url: nil
```
## Instance name
Ansible push generates inventory dynamically you have multiple options to name your instance
*use_instance_name* = false (default): <platform>
*use_instance_name* = true: <instance_name>-<platform>
*custom_instance_name*: <custom_instance_name>


## Windows support
Kitchen ansiblepush has experimental support.
to enable windows support you need to add the following to your *.kitchen.yml*

```yaml
...
transport:
     name: winrm
     winrm_transport: negotiate
provisioner:
    name                  : ansible_push
    chef_bootstrap_url    : nil
    ansible_port          : 5586
    ansible_connection    : "winrm"
...
```
## Pattern of usage
You can use ansible push  with different pattern. I will list some of the ways that I use it, But by no means they are the only patterns.
### Roles

I define my Gemfile in the role. I then run ```bundle install``` and commit my *Gemfile.lock* I also ignore ```.kitchen```

A typical structure of an ansible role

```yaml
defaults
handlers
meta
tasks
templates
vars
Gemfile
Gemfile.lock
.gitingore
test
    \_ ansible.cfg
    \_ integration
            \_ server
                \_ server.yml   # my play that will test something
                \_ serverspec
            \_ worker
                \_ worker.yml # my play that will test something
                \_ serverspec

```
